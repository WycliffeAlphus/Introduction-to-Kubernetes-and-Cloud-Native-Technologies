## Hands-On Exercises

Let's explore these alternative tools through practical exercises. Each exercise includes setup instructions, basic usage, and links to additional resources.

### Exercise 1: Getting Started with Podman

**Prerequisites:**
- Linux system (Ubuntu, CentOS, or Fedora recommended)
- Basic familiarity with command line
- Internet connection for downloading images

**Installation:**

For Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install podman
```

For CentOS/RHEL:
```bash
sudo yum install podman
```

For Fedora:
```bash
sudo dnf install podman
```

**Basic Usage:**

First, let's run a simple container to verify Podman is working:
```bash
podman run hello-world
```

This command downloads and runs a test container, similar to Docker's hello-world image.

Now, let's run a web server in rootless mode (one of Podman's key advantages):
```bash
podman run -d -p 8080:80 --name my-web-server nginx
```

Check the running container:
```bash
podman ps
```

Access the web server by opening a browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8080`.

**Working with Pods (Podman's Special Feature):**

Create a pod with multiple containers:
```bash
# Create a pod
podman pod create --name my-app-pod -p 8080:80

# Add a web server to the pod
podman run -d --pod my-app-pod --name web-server nginx

# Add a database to the same pod
podman run -d --pod my-app-pod --name database postgres:alpine
```

List pods:
```bash
podman pod ls
```

Stop and remove the pod:
```bash
podman pod stop my-app-pod
podman pod rm my-app-pod
```

**Advanced: Rootless Containers:**

Run a container as a non-root user:
```bash
# This runs without requiring sudo
podman run -d -p 8081:80 --name rootless-nginx nginx
```

The container runs with your user privileges, enhancing security.

docker swarm init
```

This command sets up your machine as a Swarm manager node. You'll see output with a token for joining worker nodes.

Verify the swarm:
```bash
docker node ls
```

**Deploying a Service:**

Create a simple web service:
```bash
docker service create --name web-service --replicas 3 -p 8080:80 nginx
```

This creates a service with 3 replicas of nginx containers.

Check the service:
```bash
docker service ls
docker service ps web-service
```

**Scaling the Service:**

Scale up the service:
```bash
docker service scale web-service=5
```

Scale down:
```bash
docker service scale web-service=2
```

**Creating a Stack with Docker Compose:**

Create a file called `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    deploy:
      replicas: 3
  database:
    image: postgres:alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: mypassword
    deploy:
      replicas: 1
```

Deploy the stack:
```bash
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml my-app
```

List stacks and services:
```bash
docker stack ls
docker service ls
```

**Cleanup:**

Remove the stack:
```bash
docker stack rm my-app
```

Remove the service:
```bash
docker service rm web-service
```

Leave the swarm:
```bash
docker swarm leave --force
```
